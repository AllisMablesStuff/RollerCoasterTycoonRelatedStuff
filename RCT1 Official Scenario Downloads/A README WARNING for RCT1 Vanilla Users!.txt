A README WARNING for RCT1 Vanilla Users!

If you play RCT1 Vanilla (basically, Vanilla is an RCT enthusiasts'
retronym for any official version of RCT1 that is NOT OpenRCT2), then
the long filenames used in this folder can cause problems
with your scenario list. The Vanilla editions were created back in
the 16-bit DOS days when filenames were 8 characters with no spaces.
Therefore, long filenames can sometimes cause the Competitions tab of
the scenario selector to show gaps in the listing, and not open
scenarios when you click on them. Therefore you must be careful
which files you add to you RCT1 Vanilla's scenario directory.

>> If you ONLY play RCT1 through OpenRCT2 and don't plan on playing
these scenarios in RCT1 Vanilla, you may use this folder to add
scenarios to your RCT1 Scenarios Directory. OpenRCT2 is a modern, 
open-source implementation of RCT that does NOT have a problem with
with the modern-style long filenames in this folder. The files in
this folder have descriptive file names.

>> If you ALSO play RCT1 Vanilla, then the files in this folder may
cause the Competitions tab in your scenario selector to show gaps
in the listing and scenarios that don't open. Look for a folder named
"RCT1 Vanilla Official Scenario Downloads - Short Filenames"
in this GitHub repository and use those files instead. This folder
has less descriptive filenames, but will not cause problems with the
RCT1 Vanilla scenario list.

NOTE: You must pick one folder or the other. Both folders have
the same files, just the names are different. You do NOT want
both sets of files in use at once, as this may cause duplicate
listings in OpenRCT2 and unexpected behavior in RCT1 Vanilla!
If you change your mind, be sure to make sure no RCT games are
running, and delete the old set of files before adding in the new
set of files!
