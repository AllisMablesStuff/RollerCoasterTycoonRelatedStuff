Here are the Extra scenarios with numbered file names for use with RCT1 Vanilla. 
This vintage game is expecting old fashioned 8-character MS-DOS style names, 
so changing them to modern long filenames causes them to sometimes not open properly.
However, on OpenRCT2, this problem is resolved.

Just copy the contents of this directory (not the directory itself!) into your RCT1 
Vanilla Scenarios directory, and you're good to go!


Here is a description of the scenario files, copied from
